You can find the requirements to import him to Scotland here: http://www.pettravel.com/immigration/Scotland.cfm. Note that, as New Zealand is considered a rabies-controlled country by the EU, a titer test is not required.Traveling is stressful on everybody, but if Scruff is in good health and is acclimated to his crate, he will should be fine.

Microchip implantation2. rabies vaccination (it must be older than 21 days when entering Europe!)3. issuing some identification papers for the dog (not specified what those papers must contain).4. ?However, unfortunately from point 3 on it is not clear what the Austrians want.When the pet comes from another European country then they want the European pet passport for No.3.If the pet comes via flight, they MIGHT want a certificate - that would be No.4. - that the pet is healthy but it is not clear, if the certificate is really necessary for an accompanied pet or not and within how much time it must be issued before entering the flight.I tried to ask Air Austria, but they only sent me a weblink (which I had known before) and the content under that link is confusing to put it mildly.This is the link they sent to me.http://www.austrian.com/Info/Flying/TransportationAnimals.aspx?sc_lang=en&cc=ATIt goes further here:http://bmg.gv.at/home/EN/Topics/Information_for_Travellers/Veterinary_conditions_regarding_the_entry_and_re_e  ntry_of_pet_animals_from_third_countries_into_Aust  riaI have been emailing with the employees of this carrier for a couple of days now, especially the Canadian department as we would travel from Canada to Vienna, and somehow, no one wants to let me know what the airline wants at the Toronto check in (sometimes the airline has some extra demands for the passenger pets above the demands of the destination country).The Air Austria pet travel experts (or rather \"experts\") always refer to the second link above whose content is rather confusing and refuse to give any further explanation.For example in the information leaflet there is talk about a certificate which must be issued within 10 days of entry to Austria. In the model certificate again, the talk is about 24 hours. And so on.Especially the model certificate is a catastrophy as I am afraid that all non-lawyers get lost in it.

For example, the airlines say they only accept some many dogs per flight. We will be there at earliest check in 4 hours before but can we still walk our dogs around by the airport and only send them through 2 hours before? Do they go with the baggage people and then we go through security? What happens when we land in Miami? Do you get the dogs back at baggage claim and go through customs? What is that like? This is after immigration right? Can I take them to a pet relief area before my connection? Will I have go back through security? Where do I check them in again? Where do we collect them in Chicago?? Thank you anybody for any info. you have.\r\t", "date": "07-10-2012,\u00a001:43 PM"},

I would imagine it is rather a \"high-risk\" than \"third country\", but it doesn't occur on either list that I found through PetTravel.. Can anyone help me with this? Are there rules for countries that do not occur on these lists?\rI read that for entering Finland \"from a Country with a High Incidence of Rabies, quarantine can be avoided by having a Blood Titer Test done after vaccination and 3 months prior to travel.\"I know I could have a chip put and this test done around here, but due to the cat's age it would only be around mid-May - leaving 1,5 months prior to planned travel. Is this unavoidably too little time? Would the cat likely be quarantined, or can there be some sort of exceptions to this 3-month rule?\rIt isn't easy, but I'd still like to see if it somehow could work out..

I would like to arrange for a horse stall to be placed in the main cabin cargo at the tail section of a 740M combi passenger/cargo plane, such as the combi planes that KLM flies out of Amsterdam.

So, I would like to order the horse stall, but then place my two galgos in their SkyKennels inside the horse stall. I asked about this with a KLM ticket agent, and they didn't say yes, but they didn't say no either. It will be $$$$$.

We pretty much know all of the rules and restrictions to get them there, but this last trip home from Prague, we had a problem.  My dog that is small enough to travel on the plane with us figured out how to chew out of and break the zippers of the bag she is supposed to travel in.  Between Prague and Munich, she chewed out of the carrier and we rushed into the luggage shop at the airport and bought a new carrier...made our connection to Los Angeles...within the first 30-minutes we saw a guy pointing to the ground in the isle...there was our little doggie staggering up the isle (she was on a double dose of doggie downer prescribed by her vet).  The flight attendants were very mad and told us that they would have to land the plane if I could not keep her in the carrier.  I tried to hold it shut, but it was not working.  Our dog is the sweetest dog, and would never hurt anyone, but hates being put in any kind of confined area.  When the flight attendant in charge came to talk to us, she could see that we were very distressed, but they have strict rules.  She said that they would block off one of the rest rooms and I could sit in there with her.  So, for the next 8.5 - 9 hours I sat in the bathroom with her.  Thy allowed me to return to my seat for landing and hold her between my legs on the ground.  I need to travel back to Prague in March...

{"topic": "travel come from Canada", "author": "tourist2012", "message": "Although London is a fantastic hub for culture, history and everything in between, it\u2019s nice to get out once in a while. For this and many reasons, it\u2019s always helpful to know of your travel options whenever you want to get out of London.Whilst driving has its benefits, no-one wants to deal with traffic and the exhaustive nature of driving all the time, particularly when you are on holiday. If you want to go further afield, and not waste lots of money whilst you\u2019re at it, then you should definitely look into the benefits of rail travel, especially since there are always cheap train fares available.Rail LinksThe rail network links you to all the major locations within the UK. East Coast Trains, for instance, have major routes and services connecting you from London Euston all the way to Edinburgh. This gives you quick and easy links to Leeds, York and Newcastle, all major cities situated across the UK.Additionally, stopping via Edinburgh can help you reach further locations, such as Glasgow, Inverness and Aberdeen, covering most of Scotland.The only other methods that do this, offering you a surprising amount of freedom and flexibility, are driving, which can be expensive and tiring, and flights, which are more limited due to needing the airport. So, your best option for traveling outside London definitely seems to be using the train.Cheap TravelOf course, finances are always going to be important. Not everything has vast amounts of money to dedicate to something as simple as travel, so it helps to know when is possible. This helps on the longer journeys, such as those going all the way up to Scotland, where you want the trip to be as cheap as possible.If you book in advance, you can make the most savings. This not only saves you money but gets you a seat on the train; something to be thankful for on some of the longer journeys.In short, it\u2019s not often that you\u2019ll want a break from London, but when you do need to get out, it helps to know that there are plenty of options, giving you lots of choice without straining your wallet. With cheap affordable routes both in and out of London, it seems that trains should be your first port of call next time you want to venture beyond the city.\r\t", "date": "12-26-2012,\u00a002:00 AM"},

FYI, my employer is paying for my flight, but I'm not sure how much they're willing to pay.\rThere aren't very many airlines that service Riga, and there are even fewer that will fly a dog out of Dallas in the middle of July.  My options have pretty much come down to these:\r1. Cheapest option: Fly Dallas to Chicago on SAS operated by United, 5 hour layover.  Chicago to Copenhagen on SAS, 6 hour layover. Copenhagen to Riga on SAS operated by airBaltic.  (This one makes me nervous because it involves three airlines and two long layovers.)\r2. Mid-Price option: DFW to Chicago on Lufthansa operated by United, 57 min layover.  Chicago to Frankfurt on Lufthansa operated by United, 10.5 hour layover in Frankfurt.  Frankfurt to Riga on Lufthansa.(Once again, a very short and very long layover, but at least this one is in Frankfurt, and only requires two airlines.)\r3. Expensive option: Basically the same as #1, but with shorter layovers.\r4. Most expensive option: DFW to Frankfurt, 1 hr. layover, Frankfurt to Riga.  All on Lufthansa.\rSo... I'm leaning toward options 2 & 4 because United and Lufthansa have good reputations.

There are several other airlines that serve this route: British Aireays, Air Berlin and Iberia. That said, these airlines have restrictions on carrying your pet as cargo out of Dallas in July. This time of year is difficult for the airlines because the pets will be exposed to higher temperatures in holding areas and on the tarmac. You need to check with the airline to see if additional charges and restrictions apply as they sometimes do on codeshare arrangements. Again, the route with Lufthansa is so much cleaner and faster.Susan\r\t", "date": "02-24-2013,\u00a009:35 PM"},

{"topic": "Double Charge of in-cabin Fees", "author": "robincolorado", "message": "Just starting on a journey with 2 Shih Tzu young adults from the Philippines to the US.  I decided to book on Delta since they seem to be the most amicable to in cabin pet travel for an international flight. There are 2 humans traveling as well. Delta charges $200 per pet for in cabin travel, which I was aware of and not opposed to pay.  Yes I agree with some of the arguments about the fees that I have read, but what are you going to do?  My argument is this;  Delta booked me all the way on one reservation from Manila to Denver (manila to tokyo, tokyo to Seattle, Seattle to Denver), for which I will pay $200 per pet at the ticket counter when I fly in a few days.  The last leg of my flight from SEA to Denver was to be flown by Alaska Air, but booked by Delta with a Delta flight number.  Delta instructed me to call Alaska separately to alert them that I was traveling with in cabin pets.  I did and Alaska Air informed me that they would charge me $100 each pet to fly from SEA to Denver.  Now that I was opposed to.  I will have already paid Delta to fly me from MNL to DEN and paid them for the pets.  But now Alaska says they will charge me at their ticket counter again for the pets.  I immediately called Delta back and explained what had happened.  The customer service agent checked with a supervisor and it was confirmed that Alaska Air can and will charge extra for the pets for the last leg of my flight.  So I cancelled my flight going to SEA-TAC and instead booked my flight through MSP to Denver (MNL to Tokyo, Tokyo to MSP, MSP to DEN).  MSP was not my first choice of airports to fly through, however, since the continuing flight to Denver was a Delta plane and there would be no additional charge for the two dogs to fly the rest of the way.  I just found this surprising and a word to the wise when flying international and using connecting flights when arriving in the US, even if it is booked on one reservation.  Not knowing this cost me about 3 hours of sleep, due to the added time of changing reservations.  Delta was immensely helpful in booking my reservation and I have heard that Alaska Air is a very pet friendly airline. However, I was not willing to pay two pet fees when it was booked by Delta and was considered to be one continuous journey to my destination of Denver.  Evidently Delta and Alaska Air do not work well together when it comes to sharing fees.I will report back here when my journey is complete from Manila Philippines to Denver Colorado, USA with 2 dogs.  I have done a lot of research on this trip over the past 2 years since I bought the pups in the Philippines 2 years ago.  I hope my research pays off, although, even with all my research, I was not expecting the snag I hit this morning when booking my tickets.

KLM does the same through their hub city,  Amsterdam from Vancouver with a 6 hour flight to Dubai. Austrian Air has  a 2-stop route through Chicago to Vienna and 5.5 hours to Dubai. The  requirements for entering Germany, Italy or the Netherlands would be a  microchip and then a rabies vaccination a minimum of 21 days prior to  entering. (You will also need an Annex II form). Additionally, there are  no residency requirements to enter these countries.Most all the  countries around the UAE will require a titer test 3 months ahead of entering Dubai because the UAE considers them as high-rabies  countries. Your Pom is banned from entering Saudi Arabia (can you  imagine?). To import a pet to Qatar, you must be returning to Qatar,  intending  \t\t\tto reside in the country or have a work visa. One exception is  Bahrain and a titer test is also required to enter Bahrain, but  that may be a possibility for you as quarantine should not be imposed  with a titer test. You can find import regs for all countries here:  http://www.pettravel.com/passportnew.cfm.Should you decide to  fly to Bahrain, (and we would have to check if there are residency  requirements) then Lufthansa can get you there through Frankfurt or KLM  through Amsterdam.

If you  navigate to this page: http://www.pettravel.com/petpassportnew.cfm, you  can find regulations for every country in the world listed. Each country  has different forms and regulations. For the EU, because Laos  is a high-rabies country, the following process must be followed. First  you implant a 15 digit microchip (if you do not stock these, we have a  vet/breeder program and sell them at a very reasonable price.  (http://www.pettravelstore.com/microchips-for-vets-and-breeders/). After  the microchip is implanted, you vaccinate the pet for rabies. It does  not matter if the pet has a current vaccination, you must re-vaccinate  AFTER the chip is implanted. Then your client will wait 30 days (not  including the day of the visit where the chip was implanted) and you  will do a blood titer test and send the sample to an approved lab.  Assuming acceptable results, your client can travel to the EU 90 days  after the day the blood was taken for the titer test. You will need an  Annex II form (which is the same as a Third Country Veterinary  Certificate) for the specific country within 10 days of travel (each  country has a different Annex II form). For Norway, Finland and the UK,  you must do a tapeworm treatment within one and five days of travel.  Details and we also have links for instructions and all forms required  here if you need them: http://www.pettravel.com/immigration/Norway.cfmAs  for Korea, requirements are different. Korea requires a microchip, then  a rabies vaccination no sooner than 30 days and not more than one year  prior to import. Entering from a high-rabies country such as Laos, a  titer test is required. It should be given at least 30 days after the  second booster (for puppies) and a regular vaccination for pets who have  had current vaccinations. This allows the antibodies to build up in the  blood and ensures a good score on the titer test. The test must be  given more than 30 days but nor more than 2 years prior to entering the  country. You can find more detail here again with links to instructions  and forms if you need them:  http://www.pettravel.com/immigration/korea.cfmLet us know if you have additional questions.Susan\r\t", "date": "09-20-2014,\u00a002:15 PM"},

Could her size afford her the opportunity to travel in the cabin? This is always the best option, but not available if she is too big. If she has to travel in the hold, this makes things a bit more difficult, but thousands of pet owners do this safely with their pets every year. As a pet owner, it would be your responsibility to prepare her for the trip. (get the crate early and train her to like being inside of it - take her outside of her environment in the crate, etc.) If she is not prepared, she will suffer more. You should also talk to your vet about a calmer, be it all-natural or a mild sedative, to calm her anxiety. If she has health issues, then that is one thing. But if she is a healthy dog, the chances of her dieing en route are not significant, especially if she is properly prepared.Every person can approach your issue differently. A new baby is certainly demanding, but not all encompassing. Dogs will relish every bit of attention they can get and love you for it. And Jacks are very intelligent and loyal.

I am currently keeping the puppy at my house until it is old enough to travel. My nephew was told by his veterinarian in Norway that the puppy had to be three months old before getting a rabies vaccination shot and then wait another 3 weeks before it could travel to Norway. I want to make sure I have ll my ducks in a row before making expensive travel arrangements to bring the puppy there. I realize the puppy needs to be micro-chipped before the rabies shot and be treated for tape worms 1-5 days ahead of travel.

From a veterinary standpoint, the antibodies that puppies get from their mother eventually \"wear off\" and puppies are not protected from rabies. The standard age for vaccination is 3 months, but many people who have been involved in importing puppies into the EU have had them vaccinated way to early putting the puppy's health at risk. To address the health of all puppies, the EU decided to enforce this regulation and the US has also done the same.

Then wait 30 days and have your vet administer a Blood Titer Test. Assuming acceptable results, your cats can enter Germany 90 days after the day the blood was drawn for the titer test.

If a titer is performed and any animal receives favorable results, why then wait 90 more days.

So the EU's rationale is that, if, by any chance, your pet has contracted the disease prior to the vaccination, then the symptoms will have surfaced within 90 days. It is in the abundance of caution that the EU Commission and DEFRA made that law. It used to be 6 months prior to entry that the titer test was given. In 2012, it was reduced to 3 months.

{"topic": "Some questions about moving to Russia with cats", "author": "takaik", "message": "Hi. I plan to move from the US to Russia some time this fall, and I found all the information on your site very helpful. But I still have questions. My main issue is I have two cats and, if I understood correctly, I can only take one into the cabin with me. I don't feel comfortable putting one into cargo hold, especially my senior cat who is very attached to me. And I've heard pet carriers in cargo are treated just like any other luggage and are tossed around and stuff. Anyway, cargo is out of the question. Are there any airlines that would allow for two pet carriers in the cabin? Or would they have to be two cats in one carriers, while still meeting the weight restrictions? The two cats don't get along very well, so I'm afraid they may fight throughout the flight and stress each other out. Can I possibly take two pet carriers into the cabin if I, say, don't take anything else as far as carry-on goes? I don't know what to do, any advice would be greatly appreciated. \rAnother question. The information page says that only two Moscow airports have the facilities to clear pet customs. I'm flying to Saint Petersburg. Does that mean I'll have to get a ticket that will bring me to Moscow first and then a connecting flight to Saint Petersburg from there (Aeroflot)? I usually fly with Finnair, which goes to Helsinki and then puts me on a connecting short flight to Saint Petersburg. Will I not be able to do that?\rAnother question. Pet microchip is not required in Russia. So if I fly to Moscow, then to Saint Petersburg, I don't need one. But if my connecting flight is in any other European country (e.g. Finland), will it be required because I'm making a transfer there? \rThanks in advance. I may have other questions later.\r\t", "date": "06-19-2014,\u00a009:40 PM"},

My dog that is small enough to travel on the plane with us figured out how to chew out of and break the zippers of the bag she is supposed to travel in. Between Prague and Munich, she chewed out of the carrier and we rushed into the luggage shop at the airport and bought a new carrier...made our connection to Los Angeles...within the first 30-minutes we saw a guy pointing to the ground in the isle...there was our little doggie staggering up the isle (she was on a double dose of doggie downer prescribed by her vet). The flight attendants were very mad and told us that they would have to land the plane if I could not keep her in the carrier. I tried to hold it shut, but it was not working. Our dog is the sweetest dog, and would never hurt anyone, but hates being put in any kind of confined area. When the flight attendant in charge came to talk to us, she could see that we were very distressed, but they have strict rules. She said that they would block off one of the rest rooms and I could sit in there with her. So, for the next 8.5 - 9 hours I sat in the bathroom with her. Thy allowed me to return to my seat for landing and hold her between my legs on the ground. I need to travel back to Prague in March...

We only had 2 options - KLM or Turkish Airlines. We flew with KLM Manila-Taipei-Amsterdam-Copenhagen. We had to rebook our tickets because one of our dogs got sick because of the rainy season started. I just asked for a new transition permit from Taiwan and the send it per email the day after. I think they are checking their inbix every now and then to see if there is any urgent requests. Been emailing with them before a couple of times and they always replied quickly and in a nice way. When we arrived in Taipei we got a transit sticker and a woman told us to sit and wait. We had the permit ready, but they never asked for it. She just told us they faxed it to KLM and its already recorded in their system. We had no layover, since it was only a quick stop where we had to leave the plane for cleaning and then wait in the boarding area. We were the first to board because of the dogs which was nice and comfortable. The Taiwanese airport staff were very friendly and helpful also. I don't know the process if you have a long layover, but all in all we had a great experience in Taiwan. My wife brought a Shih tzu 8,2 kg including the bag, but the filipina officer just turned up the thumb and smiled at us, even the max was 8 kg. I brought a Shih tzu/Pomeranian mix 6,5 kg all in all, so no problem. We paid 200 $ per dog and got an extra seat for them all the way, which was unexpected, but super nice. The dogs had each their large sturdi bag and they fitted well under the seats. One flight attendant complimented the bag and told me she loves dogs and I should just ask if there was whatever problem. Both our dogs were barking all the time in the airports and we got a lot of attention. We trained them somebdays before and they were also sleeping inside the bags for some hours at home, but omg they went noisy at the airport. Also Foxy kept whining and barking the first half hour inside the plane, but then she was sleeping for the rest of the trip. My worst nightmare was that they would be noisy and they really were at times, but no one ever said anything negative, but I could feel some passengers felt annoyed. My wide also told me that one of the attendants was snobbish and arrogant. We were separated inside the plane because only one dog per cabin stretch. Most of the staff were very friendly and smiling, but of course don't expect everyone to be a dog lover. After departing I just took Foxy out of the carrier which I placed on the empty seat beside me and then she was sleeping on my lap under a blanket. No one said anything. I also gave her a little food on the way and some water. Just used the plastic cup from the plane. She was also wearing a diaper. The plane from Amsterdam to Denmark was smaller and I put the bag on lap, but the attendant told me to put it under the seat as I already knew, since I flew all the way from Manila. Didn't want to argue og tell her they allowed me on the other legs. Just said OK and put her under and she started crying. Then I used the upper window where I could slide my fingers inside between the licked zipper and gave her a treat. The bags are awesome... I just removed the pillows from the button and will put them bag now we are back home. Instead I went to the sewing shop and got 2 Velcro sewn on a wee pad instead. Then I added an old T-shirt as suggested here.  2 days before leaving I wrote the vet in Copenhagen airport and she asked if I could send a scan if the titer tests and she said thanks we are expecting you to clear customs. The woman on arrival just scanned the dogs chips and stamped the annex IV and smilednand said your dogs are allowed to stay legally. That's all I remember he he. It was a long haul, but finally we are at home and the dogs are sleeping, drinking and eating like crazy.\r\t", "date": "07-27-2015,\u00a006:37 AM"},

They carry animals and we understand that their holds are larger than many. There are 2 ways that larger pets can fly: accompanied checked baggage and manifest cargo.

{"topic": "from Nicaragua to Austria: new EU regulations, transport bags, airlines..", "author": "admin", "message": "Hi Marie - for what we found, the route between Managua and Vienna  (weren't sure what cities you were traveling from and to) is served by  Air Berlin in its entirety. This is a good thing because, when you  change airlines, it will most likely cause you to have to clear customs  and enter the country to get to the next airline. If your kitty is  traveling in the hold, the airlines will not transfer your kitty to  another airline and so that is why staying on the same airline is a good  thing. However, their route is not the best one and it has long  layovers in Miami and Dusseldorf. You may want to contact Delta and KLM.  They share routes between these cities. You need to ask them whether  your kitty can travel in the cabin and also whether you will have to  clear customs to change planes between the two carriers. As your  final destination is in the EU, their requirements for pet import are  the same with the exception of the Annex IV form (health certificate).  The form you use depends on the country that you first enter. Once you  have entered the EU, you can use the form for 4 months for any country  within the EU. So, if you change airlines, do so in the EU and leave  yourself time to clear customs if it is necessary to do so. Don't  worry about the Border Inspection Points. If you are traveling with  your pet, most of the international airports are BIPs. To conform to  requirements to enter the EU, your kitty must first be microchipped,  then vaccinated for rabies - in that order but same vet visit is fine.  Then you will wait for 30 days, not including the day of the vet visit  to have the vaccination done. Then your vet will do a Blood Titer Test.  Assuming acceptable results, your kitty can enter the EU 3 calendar  months after the date the blood was drawn for the titer test. You will  need an Annex IV form for the first country you enter in the EU. That is  why you need to speak to the airlines about their routes. You can find  more details here and links to instructions and forms to enter Austria  if you need them: http://www.pettravel.com/immigration/Austria.cfm. If  you need to clear customs in another EU country, then go here to find  details for that country: http://www.pettravel.com/passportnew.cfm.As for the carrier, you should get something soft sided if your pet is traveling with you in the cabin. This will allow you to \"squish\" down the carrier so it will fit under the seat during takeoff and landing.Let us know if you have further questions.Susan\r\t", "date": "01-02-2015,\u00a010:11 AM"},

{"topic": "from Nicaragua to Austria: new EU regulations, transport bags, airlines..", "author": "admin", "message": "Stephanie - the requirement that your cat stand up and turn around is when the carrier is on the counter. Delta is quoting you the height under the seat in front of you. If your kitty is traveling in a soft sided carrier, you can \"squish\" it down to get it under the seat. Most all pet travelers travel with soft sided carriers for this reason. Many people travel with a cat in the cabin, but you need to get your cat accustomed to its carrier far in advance of flying so there will not be behavior problems.Most likely, United will not permit your pet to travel in the cabin on this route. Make sure that they will not require that an agent handle the transport as they require that for many South and Central America flights. The US will need to see proof of rabies vaccination at least 30 days prior to entry and a health certificate. Do not plan to stay in the US because you need to get to Austria within the 10 day window of the Annex IV form.  hope this helps.Susan\r\t", "date": "01-02-2015,\u00a005:29 PM"},

This time, I can't use my voice to calm them down and sooth them. I read that putting a shirt of mine in the crate might help to comfort them. \rcdmtooth\r\t", "date": "03-02-2015,\u00a011:37 AM"},
{"topic": "Old Deaf Dog Traveling In-cabin on long International Flight - Need Advice", "author": "admin", "message": "Cdmtooth - it is difficult to travel with older pets that have physical disabilities. If, once airborne, you take the carrier and put it in your lap and hug and stroke your pet, will it calm down? We would suggest that you get a window seat away from flight attendants and other people so that you can attend to your pet. At some point, they should settle down when they are so physically near you. We carry natural pet calmers in our store and maybe you can find something like that in South Korea. Research natural herbs and perhaps you can mix them with cheese as a treat. Obviously, you need to speak with your vet about this. Practice this at home when watching television. Sit in a chair and put them in their carrier then in your lap. Do this night after night for as long as it takes. Hold them tight so they can't scratch. Sure hope this helps.

We are moving to Ireland from perth and want to bring our daughters much loved cat!  I have been quoted from some very costly international movers and to be honest it seems a huge expense so far it seems it's about 2700 dollars not to mention getting paperwork, vet pet passport etc.  if anyone can actually give me any guidance here to try and get him home safely but without crippling the bank I would appreciate any thing at all.  I have seen that quantas do a international flying pet service again not sure the full theory of this I will contact them to get a price but to be honest I actually don't use them as an airline we usually travel with Singapore airlines, any help on this would be so appreciated thanks\r\t", "date": "04-08-2015,\u00a012:01 AM"},

We kept her with us the whole 2 months in California.  On our journey back to Dubai we reached LAX with the puppy to bring her home.  As she was a registered as an emotional support puppy.  She had all the injections required. Once we arrived at LAX they turned us down because on Emirates Air they don't allow animals to fly in the cargo due to the long journey.. Which we informed we could bring her along with us in our flight home. So I left my daughter with her puppy and returned home to Dubai.. Waiting for my daughter to send her by cargo on another airlines.  Now our puppy was on her way to her new family in Dubai only to be rejected once again for not having her blood test.  We always bring pets from the state and we never knew they changed the regulations for the USA. We were devastated when I went to pick her up and discover we were missing a document that shows we took her blood to be sure she did not have rabies... Then The Dr in UAE informed us she could not enter and we had 48 hours to either send her back (with no family there to pick her up) or put her to sleep.  I was shocked and started crying and reached out to anyone who could help us.. I asked around and nobody could and we would have to decide.  From word of mouth and by Our prayers a very nice Sheikh from Dubai got a hold of this story and immediately took action.  We were able to save our puppy and she was delivered to our home..  We can't thank enough the people   who reached out and went out of their way to help us.   Sheikh was for sure a big animal lover. I just wish I would of read more into this before I transferred my puppy.  I help so many people in this life and this was a blessing for Sheikh to help us.  Thank you Sheikh for your help.   I will be sure to advise anyone on this new law that took effect the end of February and we were already in Los Angeles at that time.

Once your pet leaves the country, it loses the \"status\" it has gained by living there. You can inquire if a titer test will waive the quarantine requirements, but it is a long shot. As for the EU, when you are there, get a titer test for your pet. The EU will consider it good for the life of your pet as long as the rabies vaccinations do not expire.

I already have a ticket purchased on China Eastern Airlines and am trying to find the answer to a few questions.

Sometime next year my husband and I are contemplating on relocating to the Philippines.  My husband is registered partially blind and we would be taking with us his former Guide Dog, Chester.  He would not longer be a guide dog then but a re-homed Guide Dog as he will be living with us permanently abroad.  I have no idea about pet travels and I would love to get some feedback especially from those who had experienced sending their pets through a long-haul flight.  Is it best to get a Pet Travel service who can ship him, rather than take him with us as excess baggage on the same flight?  Would it be cheaper?  How about stress?  Would he be so stressed?  I have heard horrible stories of pets dying on flight and I would not want that to happen to our Chester.  He is not used to being left alone as he's been everywhere we go as a Guide Dog, he can enter anywhere he wants.  But this time he would no longer be a Guide Dog so I am scared of how he will take long haul travel on his own.  UK to the Philippines usually take between 14-20 hours, some even up to 30!  Direct flight with Philippine Airlines from Heathrow to Manila takes 14 hours.  Has anyone taken this route before?  How did it go?  What is the best airline to book with?  Would our Chester be safer if we use a Pet Travel service? Any idea about the cost in using their service? Who takes care of the required papers? Who books the flight?  Direct flights would be best but is Philippine Airlines equipped for this?  Anyone with any experience using Pet Travel services?  When do we start preparing?  I still have so many questions in mind...  All I want is the least stressful way for our Chester to travel and definitely no dying! Lol!

As far as I can tell, there are no direct flights between here (Japan) and Sweden, so we would have to take a layover somewhere. \rI'm very concerned that the first leg of this hypothetical trip would be *minimum* ten hours, maybe as much as twelve. Has anyone here ever flown with cats for such a long (12-14+ hours in planes alone) trip? I'd like to give my cats (and myself!) a chance to rest/eat/drink/poop between flights. Being able to spend the night at our layover airport would be amazing. But I'm afraid it would be impossible because of permit rules. \rIf for example, we had our layover in AMS or HEL, would we need a transit permit? What would the limits of said permit be? How long would we be allowed to stay in the airport? Are there any pet friendly places to stay within the limits of the airport so that our transit permit is still valid? \rI'm hoping to fly with the cats in cabin, for whatever difference that makes.\rIs this a feasible idea at all, or should we just not stop flying until we get to Sweden?

I will be traveling to Italy for a three month stay in the EU with arrival point in Italy at Milan (MXP). I will be going to adjoining countries to Italy for short day trips. This is not my first time with the dog in Italy and I have in fact worked with the USDA who as you know manages administrative paperwork for the introduction of dogs into the EU on behalf of Italy. My specific question is not entering but rather exiting. The USDA folks are unclear as all they manage is the introduction to various countries. \rGoing to this website (Italy/US embassy)https://it.usembassy.gov/embassy-consulates/embassy/sections-offices/fas/pet-travel-faqs-italy-u-s/In the center of the page it reads:\r\u201cMoving Cats and Dogs from Italy to the United StatesThe Italian Government requires that all cats and dogs travelling from Italy to the U.S. must have a Pet Export Certificate that can be obtained from an authorized veterinarian of the local ASL (Azienda Sanitaria Locale), who will check the validity of the vaccination against rabies\u201d.\rGoing to the drop down menu \u201cwhat is the pet export certificate\u201d\u201cThe Pet Export Certificate must be written in Italian and English and bear the following information:\u2022\tInformation pertaining to the animal (breed, sex, date of birth, color and characteristics of the coat);\u2022\tName and address of the owner;\u2022\tHealth conditions of the animal\u2022\tThe certificate must report that the animal was examined on the day the certificate was issued and was found to be clinically healthy, and that the animal was vaccinated against rabies at least 20 days and not more than 11 months before the certificate was issued.For more information please see the Italian Ministry of Health website on Animal Welfare and Travel athttp://www.salute.gov.it/caniGatti/paginaMenuCani.jsp?menu=viaggiare&lingua=italianoVERY IMPORTANT:The Azienda Sanitaria Locale (ASL) issues the pet export certificate that is valid for only six days.  Mark your calendar carefully to obtain the export certificate approximately three or four days before the departure of your pet from the country. Within 48 hours before you apply for the cat or dog export certificate, you must obtain a certificate of good health for your cat or dog from a local veterinarian to present to the ASL office\u201d.Last years Annex IV form heading was \u201cNon-Commerical movement\u2026\u201d. It has been modified this year (specifically for Italy but perhaps others) and it now reads \u201cModel animal health certificate\u2026.\u201d\rI am aware that the certificate is good for four months for travel to other EU countries that have the same or similar entry requirements. My issue is trying to understand if the dog will need the export certificate (and all that goes with it) upon departure from Italy and returning to the US?  When you are traveling by car for example from Italy to France you do not need an export certificate so why they would want one when leaving Italy and returning to in my case the US is something I cannot understand as it is the same thing other than when returning to the US, the current annex IV certificate that you entered with is in fact void for reentry. \rThank you and I apologize for this lengthy question but I wanted to provide you as experts all of the details as lengthy as they may be. Perhaps this is outside of the scope of what you do but was hoping you may have some insight or maybe I am making this more difficult or simply reading into something that I shouldn\u2019t. \rBTW this is by far the best website I have found for pet travel information.

This is no longer the case as that legislation was basically nullified when EU Regulation 576/2013 was issued in December of 2014. It is this legislation that defines commercial versus non-commercial transport of dogs, cats, ferrets, amphibian, reptiles, birds, mammals, rodents and rabbits.Another thing that is unclear is whether the export permit is for pets who are residents of Italy traveling to the US only versus pets that are visiting Italy and returning to the US. Technically, after spending 4 months in any EU country, a pet becomes a \"resident\" of the country and can get an EU Pet Passport from that country. However, pets visiting Italy should be able to return to the US as long as their rabies vaccination has not expired and the airline does not require a new health certificate.We are not stating that the export permit is not necessary, but we cannot find reference to it on the Ministry of Health website.

In reading your response, I think you stated something that I had not thought of, that being 576/2013 supersedes many of the old rules. Upon departing last year after a two month visit, the Airline person who was checking us in wanted a health certificate. I kind of talked them out of it stating that the Annex IV form satisfied that requirement and eventually she let us pass and ticketed us. This year as I stated Annex IV states \"animal health certificate\" in the heading. I too did wonder if the export certificate was for pets residing in Italy. In any case, I think I have confidence that it will be safe to just go and provide Annex IV when requested. Coming in not one official wanted to see it Annex IV.

{"topic": "Pet Transport Services", "author": "admin", "message": "Hi Emily - we are transporters ourselves and, in response to your inquiry, would ask you to consider a few things. First of all, the cost of transporting a dog as air cargo is expensive, especially if you have a large dog. (you can contact the cargo department of the airlines and verify that) Routing can be complicated depending on where your pet is originating from and kenneling may be required. Secondly, it is unclear whether part of the fees include clearance services and import permit procurement on the Australian side. This may also account for part of the expense. Another consideration are the fees for entering Australia and whether they are included. Australia is an expensive country to enter with a pet, no doubt about that. Know that the government does not require that an agent do the transport, but all the t's must be crossed and i's dotted on paperwork required.

(Australia considers itself as rabies free and any rabies vaccination has to be ordered from the Government Department.) I talked to my cats vet about travelling with him, but she has no idea how to go about it. I tried finding online information about sailing overseas with a cat, but there seems not many people go sailing with their pets.\rHas anyone ever sailed with a pet and can describe the procedures to get it into or through different countries?I am thankful for any kind of information and advice.\rThank you very much.Melanie\r\t", "date": "03-31-2017,\u00a002:16 AM"},
{"topic": "Sailing with a Cat through Indonesia to Malaysia", "author": "admin", "message": "Hi Melanie - we have never sailed through the Islands of Indonesia but it sounds like a wonderful trip. As for import requirements, each country has its own regulations and Malaysia calls for quarantine. Indonesia is a bit tricky because there are high-rabies islands like Bali and rabies-free islands like Lombok, so you need to know this. As beautiful as Bali is, legally, its borders are closed to cats and dogs. Not sure about veterinary enforcement in harbors, however. You can find requirements to import your cat to many countries here: http://www.pettravel.com/passportnew.cfm.

I have heard/read conflicting statements on this. The CDC seems to say it is, but how can I be sure? Is there someone to call? FINLAND IS CONSIDERED RABIES-FREE BY THE UNITED STATES - CDC IS THE AUTHORITY ON THIS. YOU CAN CONFIRM BY EMAILING CDCANIMALIMPORTS@CDC.GOV IF YOU WANT TO CONFIRM.2. Is it necessary for me to fly with them considering all the circumstances? IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR YOU TO FLY WITH YOUR PUPPIES, HOWEVER, OWNERSHIP WILL NEED TO BE CLARIFIED PRIOR TO TRANSPORT. IF THE TRANSPORT INVOLVES TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP FOR MORE THAN DE MINIMUS CONSIDERATION (IE YOU ARE BUYING THE PUPPIES), THEN MAY COULD FALL UNDER THE 6 MONTH RULE. IN THE ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION, FURTHER CLARIFICATION WOULD NEED TO BE CONSIDERED. SEE STEP #8 HERE: http://www.pettravel.com/immigration/unitedstates.cfm. 3. What vaccinations are mandatory? CDC AND USDA LEGISLATION REGARDING THE IMPORT OF DOGS AND CATS ADDRESSES RABIES VACCINATION. OTHER VACCINATIONS SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED AT THE ADVICE OF YOUR VETERINARIAN. OBVIOUSLY, THE PUPPIES MUST BE HEALTHY.4. Do I need a statement of cold acclimation from the local vet to fly in winter? THAT IS A QUESTION FOR YOUR AIRLINES. SOME ACCEPT THEM AND OTHERS DO NOT. GENERAL RULE IS THAT THE AIRLINES DO NOT TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS IN THE HOLD BELOW 45 DEGREES F. KNOW THAT THE ISSUE IS NOT WHEN YOUR PUPPIES ARE IN THE AIR BUT WHEN THEY ARE ON THE GROUND BEING HELD, LOADED AND TAXIED. 5. Aside from veterinary certifications, what other paperwork do I need? I would be happy to use (and pay) for your services! YOU SHOULD NEED NO OTHER PAPERWORK TO ENTER THE US. THE HEALTH CERTIFICATES SHOULD BE ISSUED WITHIN 10 DAYS OF TRAVEL. BECAUSE YOUR PUPPIES ARE ORIGINATING IN FINLAND, AN AGENT IN THAT COUNTRY WILL NEED TO BOOK YOUR PUPPIES' TRANSPORT. WE ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES OTHERWISE WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO ASSIST YOU. TRY IPATA.ORG IF YOU NEED AN AGENT TO ASSIST IN FINLAND.6. Is there anything I need to be concerned about that I have not touched on? YOU MENTIONED SEVERAL ARRIVAL AIRPORTS. HOPEFULLY, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO CLAIM YOUR PUPPIES AS THE OWNER IF YOU ARE NOT TRAVELING WITH THEM. SOMEONE WILL NEED TO CLAIM YOUR PETS AND CLEAR CUSTOMS. IF THEY ARE FLYING AS AIR CARGO, THIS WILL LIKELY BE THE AIRLINE'S CARGO FACILITY, BUT YOU WANT TO CONFIRM THAT, ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE ARRIVING OUTSIDE OF NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS.\r\t", "date": "11-15-2016,\u00a001:53 PM"},

These are the abilities that we need to manage, satisfy and sometimes amplify. So when you are selecting your puppy you will be able to see the differences between the siblings, even at this young age, Those differences are related to the dog\u2019s individual instincts, which are making him unique between his siblings. Every dog has the same canine needs but they are coming classified according to the breed. When you get a Rottweiler you need to expect a certain kind of character and temperament and be prepared to commence Rottweiler dog training as soon as you take your dog home.

I currently live in Niger, and have a small cat. I want to import my cat back to the United States when I return next September.

Those requirements are significantly more involved, and I am not even sure that they are possible to achieve in this country (microchipping, etc). Can someone let me know what their experiences have been with a Paris layover with a pet traveling in the cabin? It will be very hard for me to find a vet in this country who is certified to do all of the things necessary in France, and before I spend a lot of time on it, I want to know if it is even necessary. If it is, I will have to have him microchipped (could be difficult), then the rabies vaccine (which I would do regardless), then have a titer of blood pulled to test and prove 30 days later that his vaccine was effective, then a health certificate valid for ten days, all for a tiny layover in Paris???

{"topic": "Shipping American Staffordsire Terrier mix from Texas to Belgium", "author": "Sam", "message": "I wanted to share our experience shipping our AmStaff from San Antonio, TX to Mons, Belgium.  My husband is a Department of the Army civilian who transferred to SHAPE.  We have three large dogs, the AmStaff being the smallest, then a Bernese Mountain Dog and a Great Pyrenees.  Due to their size they have to fly as cargo. My husband transferred to Belgium in September and I will follow with-in the next year.  But we decided to send the AmStaff, Max, over first to keep my husband company.  \rWe spent about a year and a half researching shipping the dogs in case my husband received the assignment. 1. Find an airline that will ship your specific breed. Delta would not fly an AmStaff mix (restricted breed), but United would in a reinforced crate.  2. Purchase a crate.  I kept sending pictures to United Cargo to ensure the crate was acceptable. They were extremely responsive and helpful. I purchased the reinforced crate made from wood from CR8-2Fly for about ~$870. It was the XLarge size.  For our Berner, Forest,  I will need to purchase a custom crate which I am still checking with airlines to ensure they'll accept.  The Great Pyrenees, Cotton, she will need to go in an off-the shelf Giant size crate3. Acclimate dog to crate.  Every day I would have Max go in the crate building up the hours.  He actually liked the crate and would just curl up and lay down. And this is exactly what he did when we dropped him off.4. Schedule flight. Max was going unaccompanied so I wanted him to go on a direct flight. Nothing goes to Europe directly from San Antonio so it meant flying him out of Houston.  Also, because of crate size, he would need to fly out of Houston. We decided to fly him from IAH (Houston) to AMS (Amsterdam).  So I drove three hours on front end to drop him off and my husband drove three hours on his end to pick Max up. We booked the flight with United Cargo about a week out.  It was pretty simple as I initial did it online and then confirmed with a follow-up phone call.  I also called the day before the flight and made sure Max was on the manifest.5. Health certificate. Max already had the 14 digit microchip and rabies certificate, etc so it was just a matter of getting a USDA certified health certificate. Since we are retired military, we took him to vet on post that was able to sign-off on certificate. Cost was $90 to include the Advantix they applied although he takes flea and tick medicine orally once a month.  I understand that if he went to his normal vet, the paperwork would have to go up to Austin for sign-off but I cannot vouch for that.  BECAUSE HE FLEW UNACCOMPANIED, HIS HEALTH CERTIFICATE HAD TO BE DATED 48 HOURS PRIOR TO FLIGHT. Cotton and Forest will be flying with me, so their health certificates can be done as early as 10 days before they fly.6.  Flight.  We did a drive by the United Cargo area early to make sure that we were in the right place and spoke with the cargo reps to make sure we had everything for Max to fly.  We returned to process Max three hours prior to the flight.  The whole process took maybe 40 minutes and was very simple.  $1790 to ship Max as his weight with crate was 183 lbs.The reps were so nice.  They put ice in Max's water bowl and taped a Ziploc bag of 16 oz of food to the top of the crate. He flew with a yellow lab. We tracked the flight the whole way both on a flight tracker and at United Cargo website.  We saw Max land and confirmed delivery at AMS.\rThat's when things went downhill and of course, it was my husband having to deal with it and with me going frantic.  My husband could not find the dog.  From everything we had researched, it was our understanding that all incoming dogs went to the Animal Hotel where they would be checked by a vet, walked, fed, etc. That is for dogs coming in on KLM/Delta.  United does not have a cargo facility at AMS.  So my husband called me (it's 1am in Texas) to say he cannot find the dog and he kept getting directed all over AMS.  I called United Cargo and they finally track Max down and tell me that he is at WFS.  I call back my husband and he had found out the same thing.  It is now about an hour and a half after Max has landed.  So my husband goes to WFS which is a warehouse, the gate guard is asleep/hungover but finally awakes to say that the dog had not arrived yet; come back in two hours.  My husband returned and dog is there and while they would not let the owner of the dog who flew with Max back to see her dog, the guy did let my husband back to see Max.  Another two hours later, my husband finally was able to take Max and the crate. Meanwhile, in those four hours, Max had not been watered, fed or walked.  The customs lady did go in the crate to check his microchip.  But Max had not been out.  He had pooped and peed in the crate and there was no where to clean him up so my husband took him in the car for the three hour drive to Mons as is.  Oh, and it cost 80 euros to get him out of hoc. Max was also understandably timid and made no noise.  He had a sliver of wood stuck in his tooth.  My husband got some of that out and the rest Max managed on his own.\rNow he is home in Belgium. He has a nice yard to run around in and my husband cleaned him all up. After four days is starting to find his voice again, doesn't seem jet lagged and is becoming himself again.\rForest and Cotton will be flying with me and we are going into Brussels so it won't be such a long ride after a long flight.  Cotton I'm not so worried about.  She's a rescue so has been through tough things before. Forest is a baby though and I am concerned about him.  I have flown dogs before and I know it takes a little bit of a toll on them, but they have all weathered it. But i also can't see them not being with us for three years. \rAnyhow, hope this is helpful.  It certainly is an experience (and an expensive one at that).  But our dogs have replaced our five grown children and they are as much family.\r\t", "date": "11-09-2017,\u00a002:04 PM"},

A year ago she adopted a small dog. Now she needs to come back to Poland. At first she planed to wait the required time and take the dog with her, but the reason of her return is now urgent, she needs to fly back right now, so she will have the dog shipped after required time of waiting. \rThe problem is, apparently vets in Korea don't have a clue what exactly you need to do to travel with a dog to Poland from a High-Rabies Country. She asked, they don't know how to help her. \rDoes somebody know what she need to do, step by step? The dog is vaccinated and healthy. I've read this thread http://www.pettravel.com/immigration/poland.cfm, but still there are things unclear for us, and when a veterinarian doesn't know what to do, we need somebody who will tell us. \r\"If your pet is entering Poland from a high-rabies country (click here), your pet must be microchipped, then vaccinated for rabies (in that order). After waiting 30 days, a rabies titer test (FAVN) must be administered. (Have your veterinarian scan your pet's microchip prior to the titer test.)Samples must be processed at approved laboratories. Assuming test results are within acceptable limits, your pet can enter Poland no sooner than 3 calendar months after the date the blood was drawn and avoid quarantine. This step is not required unless entering Poland from a high-rabies country.\"\rI mean, the dog is already microchipped and vaccinated, and the vaccine is valid. Can the FAVN test be done now? Or does the dog need to be vaccinated AGAIN, then they have to wait 30 days, then take a blood test, then another three months of waiting? One month less means a lot. The dog is staying with my friend's boyfriend in familiar enviroment, but still, it's not gonna be easy for both my friend and her dog. \rThe dog is also small enough to fly in the cabin. Could she travel in the cabin even without the presence of the owner?\rI hope you will be able to help.\r\t", "date": "02-24-2018,\u00a004:17 PM"},

My Shih Tzu had her last two sets of annual shots in France, after travelling there from Malaysia in October 2015. She was given rabies shots both times by the French vet, despite the rabies shots in Malaysia lasting for 3 years. According to her Pet Passport, my dog is due another rabies shot now (actually about a week ago, which is slightly more than one year after the last one). \rI checked online and the rabies shot she was given is recognised as lasting for 3 years in the UK, with an annual 'top up' needed in countries where rabies is a problem. Strangely France is the same as the UK, and is in the controlled category, therefore requiring 3 year rabies shots.\rThe vet in the UK also checked online and agreed with my research, but is a bit stuck because the Pet Passport states that another shot is required now. Clearly I don't want my dog to have more medication pumped into her little body than absolutely necessary. Plus we'd like to pop across from the UK to France over Easter and don't have 21 days to spare, waiting the required period for a new rabies shot to settle before the dog travels.\rHas anyone encountered this before and if the UK vet adjusts the Pet Passport to a 3 year span between rabies shots, will that be accepted at the border?\rMany thanks.\r\t", "date": "03-16-2018,\u00a010:39 AM"},

I've worked out all of the paperwork issues, but am growing increasingly concerned about the heat.\rIn the US, most airlines don't allow pets if the temperature is over 29C/84F, but I can't find any regulations about this at Bangkok airport, where the outside temperature is almost always over 29C. It appears that many airlines that fly smaller planes at BKK do not allow pets, while airlines flying larger planes do.\rKLM has a BKK-AMS flight that leaves at midday (they don't have any other times). They have told me several times that there is no problem taking pets on this flight, even though the outside temperature may be as high as 32C. I understand that the cargo area on the 777 is fully climate controlled, but my concern is about the time the dog spends between being checked in at the counter and when the plane takes off.\rI have been told by someone who has flown with KLM on this route with a dog before that they are whisked from the air conditioned terminal onto the plane and it's not a problem. I have no idea how to confirm this, though, and I am incredibly nervous.

{"topic": "I desperately need your help bringing pets from Belgium to US.", "author": "waneman", "message": "I will try to keep this short and sweet. I'm an American that lived in Belgium for a number of years. While there, a woman I lived with worked with an animal rescue group as a foster home provider.\rI have clinical depression and trended to not be social. She adopted a small Jack Russell mix that had been brought from Spain severely injured. She gave the dog to me and told me I had to take care of it or it would die. This touch love tactic worked wonders and I found a whole new purpose in life. I became very social, walked everywhere and nursed that little girl back to perfect health.\rA year or so later, she acquired to sisters. We never could be sure about the breed but they were both very adorable and short to the ground. Of the two, one found a home. The other became mine. Those two dogs were my life and I could write volumes of our adventures.\rHere is the situation. Being there almost six years I had over-stayed my visa. Upon receiving the dogs, we promtly went to the local very and got their shots up to date and re-assigned the ownership of the embedded chips. The woman whom I lived with was legal there and said it was best to put them in her name until I could go back to the US and return to Belgium legally at which point they would be put in my name,\rTime when by and that fateful horrible day came that I had to leave. I hated leaving and I wish now I hadn't. Saying goodbye was the single hardest things I have ever had to do and I promised both that I would return for them.\rNow, in the states I had to rebuild my life and save money for my return. As time went by I stayed in touch with the woman and the dogs, daily at first but it became harder and harder for her to commit to it. She told me how she couldn't afford to pay her rent and if she were evicted, she would end up in a woman's shelter and the dogs would be taken from her.\rI began sending money - and more money, sacrificing my own life and well being. I could not let those dogs be lost in the world because of her laziness.\rEventually she began out and out extorting me, telling me if I didn't send her 500 euro per month she would move and never let me know where.\rI complied but at the same time I had to do whatever I could. A close friend I have there, whom I met walking my dogs, used the same vet so I wrote a very heart-felt letter appealing to whatever help she could give. I had high hopes because she knew me and the dogs but also I hoped she remembered the conversation about putting the chips in my name.\rI had my friend hand deliver it. She also told the vet her own personal accounts of my interaction with the dogs and how much they meant but also what she knew of the woman who had them and how she is lazy and does not walk them but only takes them right out of the building to pee and such.\rI never got even a \"sorry I can't help\" response.\rNow I weigh my options. I could go back but I would have to literally take the dogs by force as she has already told me they are now her dogs and I will never get them. I could wait until she is gone and break in and take them along with turning over the house to find their passports.  I would need all day and I hate this because I do care about the woman and I have to think it would be devastating to come home and they be gone. Still this option is one ZI consider only because the last time I saw the two dogs, they had become fat and unhealthy. They will die on her floor as she is addicted to Second Life, a game on computer.\rMy other option is to perhaps hire a lawyer and see how far that goes.\rFrom what I understand, even if I choose anhy of these options, the dogs wil have to be quarantined for I think 30 days before they can fly. I will also have to show proof of ownership which means I would have to get them re-chipped. Or I could take my chance and hope they don't check my documents at the airport, which other dog owners who have traveled from Europe to the US says happens sometimes.\rI offered a friend 10,000 euro to do all this. He turned down the offer.\rIts been five years now. I dream of those dogs nearly every night and feel sick about all this. My doctor told me upon returning to the states that leaving the dogs has had a devastating effect on my depression and had been so proud I had been so depression free when I was with the dogs.\rNow I ask this community. Upon review, do I have any options I haven't thought of? What should I do? I am truly desperate.\rI welcome any questions you might have of more details or whatever.\rThank you in advance.\rWaneman\r\t", "date": "05-13-2018,\u00a003:06 PM"},

In your case, it appears that a determination was made by custom officials either the dogs had been purchased for more than diminimus value or for being imported for purposes of adoption. There could be several reasons for this. Any dogs under 6 months of age are closely scrutinized by border officials. The fact that you were representing several owners could have caused the determination.

Note that the 'health certificate' expires after 10 days. Depending on your port of entry, you might need to check with the state veterinarian if you need an import permit for your dog.

We have 2 options for sending our pets:1) Continental via Houston (IAH) as cargo. However, when shipping animals to GRU as cargo there is an extensive customs process (no less than 6 hours) and it is highly recommended to have a customs agent. They average around $1700 USD and our company will not reimburse this expense. The good part about this option is that Continental has a proven and credible PetSafe program for check-in to pick-up. I trust them with my animals.  2) United non-stop to GRU as excess baggage. The problem with this option is that I have a snub-nosed breed and with weather conditions being, on average, less than 45 degrees in Chicago and averaging around 80 degrees in Sao Paolo, I am fearful I will be bumped from my flight due to weather embargos or worse, my animals will not be taken care of and they will suffer on the tarmac due to the heat upon arrival.

From the weight that you have provided plus the weight of the carrier is 17 pounds which exceeds the upper limit of many airlines. On international flights, the airlines do consider the weight of the carrier and the pet. Additionally, and assuming that you are originating out of SF, if you fly from SF to Paris directly, the flight may be too long for your pet to remain in the cabin. You may accomplish your objective by breaking up your trip in NY but you will have to find an airline that will allow your pet in the cabin and find an airline compliant carrier. For example, Air France has a direct flight between SF and CDG, but their weight limit is 13.2 pounds including the carrier for in-cabin travel. If your pet is traveling in cargo, I would take the direct flight. The most stressful times for the pet is generally take off and landing. Most pets sleep while in flight.

When we left, we had to leave our cat in the care of friends, who have since then been working with us to try and get her sent over to us. I have been in and out of all the hoops, rules and regulations, but when we had prepared everything for the final step, (getting her usda approved health certificate) the vet clinic started telling us that our FAVN test was out of date, and California has some new law making it more difficult for her to leave the country, but couldn't manage to be any more specific... I think they were full of crap.\rAll we've ever been informed on was what we needed to get INTO Japan, and we've taken care of it. Now we're being told we can't get her OUT of California. According to all the paperwork, all the rules I've read anywhere on the internet, that health certificate was the last thing I needed. We even had the official approval from the Japanese airport, stating she could enter the country.\rSo if we find a usda certified vet, that knows what on earth they're doing, is that still the last thing I needed? Nobody can give me any info on this mysterious new regulation that's holding her back. I can't see how the Favn could possibly be the problem, considering if I were to be heading to Europe instead, I'd have to wait another month for the thing to be 6 months old. If they were to adopt such a rule, then in a couple of weeks, I'm still good to go, but that makes it stupid that the vets wanted to take a NEW test then.\rIt's hard to search for a new vet for our friends to take her to, when we're on the other side of the world, but I think the search may be on.

I asked if it was mandatory that the certificates get this stamp and she avoided the response, telling me to come in for a consultation.\rIs this just a scam between the airline and this woman to get us to pay money for a useless stamp? (Corruption like this is common place here, unfortunately) Is this something I should worry about?\r2. The vet's certificates will be in Spanish - should I have them translated into English by a regulated translator (e.g. someone who does government documents) or can I translate them myself? \rThank you so much in advance,\rcampesina\r\t", "date": "01-24-2011,\u00a002:48 PM"},

{"topic": "Want some help", "author": "mikedyzios", "message": "Am posting this from wikipedia as a ready reference.Survival rate depends on how quickly CPV is diagnosed, the age of the animal and how aggressive the treatment is. Treatment for severe cases that are not caught early usually involves extensive hospitalization, due to the severe dehydration and damage to the intestines and bone marrow. A CPV test should be given as early as possible if CPV is suspected in order to begin early treatment and increase survival rate if the disease is found.Treatment ideally consists of crystalloid IV fluids and/or colloids, antinausea injections (antiemetics) such as metoclopramide, dolasetron, ondansetron and prochlorperazine, and antibiotic injections such as cefoxitin, metronidazole, timentin, or enrofloxacin.[29] IV fluids are administered and antinausea and antibiotic injections are given subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. The fluids are typically a mix of a sterile, balanced electrolyte solution, with an appropriate amount of B-complex vitamins, dextrose and potassium chloride. Analgesic medications such as buprenorphine are also used to counteract the intestinal discomfort caused by frequent bouts of diarrhea.In addition to fluids given to achieve adequate rehydration, each time the puppy vomits or has diarrhea in a significant quantity, an equal amount of fluid is administered intravenously. The fluid requirements of a patient are determined by the animal's body weight, weight changes over time, degree of dehydration at presentation and surface area.A blood plasma transfusion from a donor dog that has already survived CPV is sometimes used to provide passive immunity to the sick dog. Some veterinarians keep these dogs on site, or have frozen serum available. There have been no controlled studies regarding this treatment.[29] Additionally, fresh frozen plasma and human albumin transfusions can help replace the extreme protein losses seen in severe cases and help assure adequate tissue healing.Once the dog can keep fluids down, the IV fluids are gradually discontinued, and very bland food slowly introduced. Oral antibiotics are administered for a number of days depending on the white blood cell count and the patient's ability to fight off secondary infection. A puppy with minimal symptoms can recover in 2 or 3 days if the IV fluids are begun as soon as symptoms are noticed and the CPV test confirms the diagnosis. If more severe, depending on treatment, puppies can remain ill from 5 days up to 2 weeks. However, even with hospitalization, there is no guarantee that the dog will be cured and survive.\r\t", "date": "06-18-2011,\u00a007:31 AM"},

Googling has only served to confuse us, with conflicting information.We're primarily concerned about Rufus' well-being during and after the trip. The following are our concerns:-We're worried that the baggage compartment may be freezing cold at 30,000ft+. He is a small Yorkipoo puppy, at 9lbs, 1 year of age. I can see how a big dog like a Mastiff can fend off the cold, but I'm not really sure about Rufus.-We're worried about his psychological health. Being stuck in a box for 20+ hours may do untold damage to his mind. He is already deeply uncomfortable with his open-air crate at home. I cannot imagine the terror he will feel with an IATA crate.-The quarantine is 7 days, and is located about 1.5hrs away from where we will be living. Not to mention the infamous Kuala Lumpur traffic. We are really concerned that Rufus will be deprived of attention, and may die from lack of food and water. Malaysian standards of care is low at best.-We'd like to travel with him as \"carry on\" luggage. Any possibility of this for international travel?If anyone can address these concerns of ours, we will be deeply grateful.

I am an Australian (married to Egyptian) and have lived in Cairo for 10 yrs.  We have just been through a ********** and life has become really more than difficult, in order to stay here I now must work (lost business) and this means travelling in an insecure chaotic city!  I have 5 beautiful cats - 1 Siamese, 1 Chinchilla and 3 Beledi cats (not pedigree). Egypt is classed as a rabies country so in order to take them home, I must airlift them to Singapore where they go thru 3 mths quarantine then they must live for 6 months in Singapore? so six months boarding then they would go to Australia and then face another three months in quarantine - a total of 15 mths!  It would cost approx 40,000 USD for the 5 of them.  People say outside of Egypt 'find them a loving home'!  Egypt is not pet friendly, Egyptians are not generally animal lovers and the ones that are don't have much of an idea how to feed and look after them.  Most foreigners only stay 2 or 3 yrs and most people want young pedigree kittens.  I have only met one Egyptian who has a Beledi cat (no pedigree) most of them love fluffy persians.  The shelters here are mostly terrible, if they are good, they are full and I visited one 'good' one and I would not leave my cats there for one night. Before the ********** it was a bit easier but many foreigners left in a hurry and abandoned their poor animals on the streets. Many would say 'how terrible' and yes it was and is but if shelters refuse to take them and most of the emergency diplomatic flights refused to take them, what could they do.  I refused to leave mainly because of the cats.  Now my husband is ill and really we should return to Australia (he is an Australian/Egyptian), our business collapsed due to the ********** and our income is nil.  I have been offered teaching jobs many of them are at night (teaching adults english) and this means travelling thru unsafe areas in taxis that are often not so safe either.  I just needed to share this story, as I am really emotionally 'a mess' I just don't know what to do?  Thanks for reading this.  Any ideas for an almost impossible situation.

{"topic": "Proper size carrier for flying in the cabin ( with cat)?", "author": "TaraM", "message": "(sorry if this is long. I really want to get in all the details)\rThis week I will be flying with my 6 yr old cat for the first time. I have never been so stressed. I am actually moving overseas ( Canada to Europe) so flying was the only option ( other than giving my cat away, which was really, really not an option). I have gone through getting her micro chipped, vaccinated & getting her a health certificate. I am lucky that she doesn't have to endure a quarantine.\rMy concern is the flight and her carrier. I will be flying Air Canada and she will be flying in the cabin with me. Air Canada is not nearly as strict as other airlines when it comes to pet travel. Cat and carrier together can't exceed 22lbs, needs to be soft-sided and the dimensions ( which are bigger than most airlines) are: Height: 27 cm (10.5 in), Width: 40 cm (15.5 in), Length: 55 cm (21.5 in). The carrier can't be too small for the pet, with room to turn around in it. \rI bought the Sherpa Original Deluxe Carrier in medium. It is airline approved, good quality, holds up to 16lbs and meets the size requirements. My cat is a long haired, medium size cat ( probably more on the small side of medium). She is 9.6 lbs but looks bigger because she is long haired. I actually measured her fur and its just over 3 inches long. She fits the carrier really well. She can stand up and turn around and has plenty of room to lay down fully in it. Because of her long hair, she might look big in it but she really isn't ( this makes me nervous). When I called Air Canada to register her on the flight and give the carrier dimensions, the agent mentioned that the carrier will squish down to 9 inches when placed under the seat. He informed me that for take off and landing, she needs to be under the seat but once the seat belt sign goes off, as long as she stays in the carrier at ALL TIMES, I can take her out from the seat and even put her on my lap. He informed me that she needs to be able to fully sit up at 9 inches. \rAt the time of the call, I wasn't too concerned because, like I said, she isn't a big cat and the carrier was a good size for her. Later on I realized he had said sit up and not stand up. I checked online at Air Canada and they do state that the pet must be able to stand up and sit down fully while under the seat. She can stand up plenty and turn around, but she can't sit up in it fully. I got the highest carrier allowed by Air Canada ( 10.5 inches). I am staying at my parents right now and they have 4 cats - all ranging from small to medium. I put them all in the carrier and NONE of them can fully sit up. Yes, they can stand and move around but definitely not sit up fully. Now I am freaking out. I looked online and the average cat height seems to be around 10 inches and that's measured shoulder to ground. That is not even including the head. Can ANY cat fully sit up in a 9 inch space??? Has anyone traveled with a cat in the cabin before? Was your cat ( or dog) able to fully sit up in the carrier? Are airlines actually strict about this?  I am stressed because I can't fly her cargo due to cold temperatures and this is my only option.\r\t", "date": "01-15-2012,\u00a003:42 PM"},

I've looked at all of the paperwork I need to get my small mini poodle into Iran, but I was wondering if I would have any trouble getting her back into the U.S.?     I don't know what the requirements would be for her after coming back from the middle east or if there would be any.

{"topic": "Pet BIRD travel to Brazil", "author": "Priscila", "message": "Hi, I'm relocating to Brazil in June. I live in new jersey. I have a Sun Conure that i rescued 3 years ago from an abusive owner. Since i've gotten her from her previous owner i've done everything for her well being. Now due to some circunstances i have to move out of the country, but i am doing all i can to bring her over with me. Okay so far, i've gotten the Cites export permit from USFWS and an import permit from brazil's wildlife agency. Also i've have authorazation from their Ministry of Agriculture (its their version of USDA). I'm almost okay to go. I've encountered two problems though. One is that brazil requires in their health certificate that my bird be in quarantine for 30 days, which they said can be done at home. I've contacted the USDA and they also said it can be done at home, but i have to find an accredited veterinarian to fill out the international health certificate and sign. I've called and emailed every clinic in the surrounding areas. I can't find anyone. My other problem is getting an airline that will take my bird. United and Continental says they have an embargo about taking birds. I called many airlines, only Delta said that they will send her as cargo. Which i didnt want, i wanted in cabin, but with international flights cargo will be the only thing i'll find. What i'm concerned is that, i need her to be in the same plane as me. I'm going to book my flight next week for june,  i can only make a reservation for my bird 14 days prior to travel. At least thats what delta told me. Well if anyone can give me information about avian accredited veterinarians or about airline travel international for birds, i will appreciate it. Thanks to everyone who reads my post.\r\t", "date": "03-23-2012,\u00a005:57 PM"},
{"topic": "Pet BIRD travel to Brazil", "author": "admin", "message": "As to your first problem, the USDA will only endorse USDA accredited veterinarians. Unfortunately, there is no list published so you will have to keep calling until you find a vet that is USDA accredited. You may try your state USDA office and ask them if they know of any. As to your question about airlines, I do not know if you have called these airlines, but they have reasonable routes to Brazil: US Airways, Copa, and American.Susan\r\t", "date": "03-24-2012,\u00a009:58 AM"},
{"topic": "Pet BIRD travel to Brazil", "author": "Priscila", "message": "Hi, i have contacted Copa airlines and Us airways also. As of now i've only found Delta that is allowing as cargo. I called them twice asking information about how the cargo shipment works, but they havent explained my questions to the extent that i have. Can anyone explain me how it works. My bird would go in the cargo compartment in the same flight as me? They explained that i have to be in the airport 4 hours prior to travel and fill out an air bill. They havent been clear on that part though. I mean, i dont want to just ship her. I'm going to accompany her also. Its all very confusing. When i called United, they first said i could even take her as carry in cabin, then i called again to confirm they said i couldnt even take her as cargo. I dont know what to believe.\r\t", "date": "03-24-2012,\u00a010:45 AM"},
{"topic": "Pet BIRD travel to Brazil", "author": "admin", "message": "You will need to arrive at the airport 4 hours ahead of schedule if your pet is traveling as manifested cargo. Your pet should be able to travel on the same flight as you are, but remember that your pet's reservation is no guarantee of boarding. Shortly prior to travel, Delta will look at their cargo manifest and reserves the right to bump. Although live animals rank higher than regular cargo, and bumping is not something the airlines like to do, it does happen.

I almost feel like getting a pet relocating company to finish the process as of booking flight and reservation for my bird. If i didnt care for her so much i think i would give up on taking her. I dont have anyone to take care of her for me though. I'm going to continue doing all i can until i succeed or run out of options.\r\t", "date": "03-24-2012,\u00a011:32 AM"}
